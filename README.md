# Module-5-WorkDayScheduler-

## Work Day Scheduler 

This simple work day scheduler application will help users schedule tasks to be completed during a typical workday (8am-5pm). 

The motivation behind this project was to create an application that clearly shows the date, what time it is, and lets the user save tasks for the day. This project gave me experience using dayJS and jQuery to create a user friendly application. 

[Deployed application](https://mcquo011.github.io/Module-5-WorkDayScheduler-/)

## Installation

Cloned the application starter code from GitLab class repo using git clone.

## Usage

To use this scheduler, type a task in the corresponding time slot for the current day, and press save. This task/event will remain in the allocated time slot when the user refreshes the page. If the user wants to clear tasks for the day, they can click the "clear" button. The present time block will be blue, future will be green, and past will be gray. The user can click the "launch instructions" button to see what times the colors correspond with and how to use the application.
